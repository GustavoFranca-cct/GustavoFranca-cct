### 🌱 What I'm Currently Learning

I'm focusing on building a strong foundation. My current stack includes:

* **☕ Java:** Learning the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for my core courses.
* **🐍 Python:** Using it for scripting, personal projects, and exploring data structures.
* **📚 Actively Studying:** Data Structures & Algorithms, and discrete mathematics.

### 💻 My Setup & Tools

I believe a great setup inspires great work. I've spent a lot of time crafting my personal learning environment, and it's always a work-in-progress!

* **OS:** `Arch Linux + Hyperland `
* **Code Editor:** `Intellij && Nvim`
* **Main Hardware:** `AlienWare m15 R4`
* **Peripherals:** `Keyboard: Logitech MX Mechanical Mini, Mouse: Logitech MX Master 3S, Monitor: Samsung Odyssey G5`
* **Productivity:** `Youtrack for notes and keep track of projects`

### 🎯 My Goals for this Year

* 🧠 Get a solid grasp on Data Structures and Algorithms.
* 🚀 Build and deploy my first full-stack web application.
* 🤝 Contribute to my first open-source project.
